## Forms & Routing

### 1. Member Registration Form
The Member Registration Form collects essential details from gym members for registration. The form includes:
- Full Name
- Email (must be unique)
- Password
- Confirm Password  
This information is stored securely in the `user` table of the MySQL database.

#### Backend Logic:
1. **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using the `sha256` method before being stored.
2. **Email Uniqueness**: Duplicate email addresses are checked to ensure uniqueness.
3. **Data Insertion**: After validation, user details are saved in the database.

#### Trainer Assignment:
- The `trainer_id` in the `user` table is allocated after the user takes a membership plan and is assigned a personal trainer based on their membership tier.

#### User Flow:
1. User fills out the form with required details.
2. Password is hashed, and email uniqueness is validated.
3. User data is stored in the `user` table, and they are redirected to the login page.
4. The `trainer_id` will be assigned once the user completes membership registration.

---

### 2. Membership Payment Form
The Membership Payment Form is used to complete the purchase of a membership plan. It includes the following details:
- UPI ID
- Email (must match the registered email)  
The **Training Type** and **Tier** are pre-selected on the previous page. Payment information is stored securely in the `payments` table.

#### Database Table: `payments`
- `id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier for each payment.
- `training_type`: The type of training the member selected.
- `tier`: Membership tier (Basic, Advanced, Premium).
- `amount`: The amount paid for the membership.
- `upi_id`: The UPI ID used for the transaction.
- `email`: User's email for payment verification.
- `payment_date`: Timestamp of the payment.
- `validation`: Status of the payment (default is 'no').

#### Backend Logic:
1. **Payment Information**: The form submits the UPI ID and email, while the training type and tier are pre-selected.
2. **Data Insertion**: After payment, this information is stored in the `payments` table.
3. **Validation**: The `validation` column is set to 'no' by default. The admin reviews the payment and updates the validation to 'yes' upon approval.

#### User Flow:
1. User selects a membership plan and training type on the previous page.
2. User fills out the UPI ID and email and clicks the "Pay Now" button.
3. After payment, the user is directed to a Thank You page.
4. The admin reviews the payment details, updates the validation to 'yes', allowing the member to access the member dashboard.

### 3. Member Login Page
The Member Login Page allows gym members to securely log in to their accounts. It collects:
- Email
- Password

#### Login Process:
1. **Email and Password Verification**: The system checks if the email exists in the `user` table. The entered password is hashed and compared with the stored hashed password.
2. **Trainer ID Check**:  
   - If `trainer_id` is null, the system checks the `payments` table to verify if the member has paid for their membership.
   - If `validation` is set to 'yes', a personal trainer is assigned.
   - If `validation` is not 'yes', the member is redirected to the Membership Plans page.
3. **Subsequent Logins**: If a trainer is already assigned, the member can log in without reassignment.

#### User Flow:
1. Member enters email and password and submits the form.
2. The system verifies credentials and checks for trainer assignment and payment status.
3. If valid, the member is logged in and a trainer is assigned.
4. If payment validation is not confirmed, the member is redirected to the Membership Plans page.
