                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Powerlifting is a strength sport that focuses on maximizing performance in three specific lifts: the squat, the bench press, and the deadlift. Competitors aim to lift the maximum weight possible in each of these lifts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The goal of powerlifting is to develop and demonstrate maximal strength in these core lifts. It emphasizes raw strength rather than muscle endurance or hypertrophy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Squat:</strong> Involves lowering the body by bending the knees and hips until the thighs are parallel to the ground or lower, then returning to a standing position.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bench Press:</strong> Performed lying on a bench, where the barbell is lowered to the chest and then pressed back up to arm’s length.</p>
                    <p><strong>Deadlift:</strong> Involves lifting a barbell from the ground to hip level, using the legs and back muscles.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Overload:</strong> Gradually increasing the weight lifted over time to continuously challenge the muscles and promote strength gains.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frequency and Volume:</strong> Powerlifting routines typically include multiple sessions per week focusing on the core lifts and accessory exercises. Volume and intensity are adjusted based on the lifter’s training phase.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technique and Form:</strong> Emphasis is placed on proper technique to maximize efficiency and prevent injury. Lifters often work with coaches to refine their form.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Format:</strong> Powerlifting competitions consist of three attempts per lift (squat, bench press, deadlift). The lifter's best successful attempt in each lift is recorded.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> The total of the best successful lifts in each of the three exercises is used to determine the lifter's score. The lifter with the highest total weight lifted wins.</li>
                        <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Competitions may have different weight classes and age categories to ensure fair competition among lifters of similar body weights and ages.</li>

                        <li><strong>Get a Coach:</strong> Working with an experienced coach can help you learn correct techniques and develop a structured training plan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Invest in Equipment:</strong> Proper lifting gear such as belts, shoes, and wrist wraps can support your performance and safety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rest and Recovery:</strong> Allow sufficient time for recovery between heavy lifting sessions to prevent overtraining and injury.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Maintain a balanced diet with adequate protein, carbohydrates, and fats to support muscle growth and overall strength.</li>
