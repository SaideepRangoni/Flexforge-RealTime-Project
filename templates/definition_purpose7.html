                <p>Powerlifting is a strength sport focused on the maximum weight one can lift in three specific movements: the squat, bench press, and deadlift. It involves competitive lifting where athletes perform these lifts with the goal of achieving the highest total weight combined across all three lifts.</p>
                <p><strong>Squat:</strong> A movement where the athlete lowers their body by bending the knees and hips, then returns to a standing position. It primarily targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Bench Press:</strong> Performed lying on a bench, the athlete lowers the barbell to their chest and then presses it upward to armâ€™s length. This exercise focuses on the chest, shoulders, and triceps.</p>
                <p><strong>Deadlift:</strong> Involves lifting a barbell from the ground to the level of the hips, using the legs and back muscles. It works the entire body but primarily targets the posterior chain, including the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back.</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>The primary purpose of powerlifting is to develop and showcase maximal strength in the three core lifts. Unlike bodybuilding or Olympic weightlifting, which focus on muscle size or explosive power, powerlifting emphasizes sheer strength and the ability to lift the heaviest possible weights in the squat, bench press, and deadlift.</p>
                <p>Powerlifting training is designed to improve an individual's raw strength and muscle efficiency. It involves rigorous training regimes, including progressive overload, to continually challenge and increase muscular strength. Athletes often engage in specific programming to enhance their performance in these three lifts and prepare for competitions.</p>
