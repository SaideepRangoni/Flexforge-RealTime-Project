                <div class="card-title">Progressive Overload</div>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Progressive overload involves gradually increasing the amount of weight lifted or the intensity of the exercise to continuously challenge the muscles and stimulate growth.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> This can be achieved by adding weight to the barbell, increasing the number of sets or reps, or enhancing the training volume. It's crucial to ensure that the progression is manageable to avoid injury.</p>

                <div class="card-title">Frequency and Volume</div>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Frequency refers to how often you train, while volume is the total amount of weight lifted in a workout.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Powerlifting routines typically involve training the core lifts multiple times per week. Volume and frequency should be adjusted based on individual goals, experience level, and recovery capabilities. A common approach is to train each lift once or twice a week with varying volume and intensity.</p>

                <div class="card-title">Technique and Form</div>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Proper technique and form are essential to maximize efficiency and reduce the risk of injury.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Lifters should focus on perfecting their technique for each lift by working with experienced coaches and regularly reviewing their form. Consistent practice with proper technique helps in performing lifts more effectively and safely.</p>

                <div class="card-title">Recovery and Rest</div>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Recovery involves the time needed for muscles to repair and grow stronger after intense workouts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Adequate rest between training sessions, sufficient sleep, and proper nutrition are crucial for recovery. Incorporating rest days and active recovery techniques can help prevent overtraining and improve overall performance.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-title">Nutrition and Hydration</div>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Proper nutrition and hydration are vital for supporting strength gains and recovery.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> A balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats, along with adequate hydration, can enhance performance and recovery. Tracking nutrition and adjusting intake based on training demands is important for optimal results.</p>
